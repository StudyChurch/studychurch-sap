<p>We want to get you creating small groups as soon as possible, but thought you might want to have a face first. So if you don't already have a
	<strong>profile photo</strong>, go ahead and click on the
	<strong><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></strong> to the left of the page title. Go ahead, don't be shy. We'll be here when you come back.
